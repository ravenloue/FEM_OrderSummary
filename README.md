## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid
- SCSS


### What I learned

I learned how to use the css grid, how to create custom headings and how to shrink the desktop format to fit into the mobile browser. I built this all by reading through documentation and using 'Google' to search for things that confused me.

### Continued development

I'm going to continue working through different challenges on Frontend Mentor until I'm more confident in my understanding of HTML, CSS and SCSS.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools CSS Reference Sheet](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/) - Very handy 
- [W3Schools How To](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/default.asp) - I used this to figure out how to create and adjust several of the aspects of this page
